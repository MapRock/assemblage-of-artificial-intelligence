# Assemblage of Artificial Intelligence


Over the past few years (ca. 2023–2025) I’ve been writing long-form essays (blogs) on AI—15 to 45 minutes each—grounded in 25+ years as a BI developer/architect and driven by an obsession with thinking about thinking. Along the way I wrote two printed books—Enterprise Intelligence (06-21-2024) and Time Molecules (06-04-2025), both from Technics Publications.

Today I’m sharing the third and final volume in a different form: The Assemblage of Artificial Intelligence—an online living, curated sequence of my blogs organized like a book. The title expresses the common theme through the ones I chose to include.

Please see the "book" here: https://eugeneasahara.com/the-assemblage-of-artificial-intelligence

The fundamental theme is a "NOLLM" view—Not Only LLMs. As we've reached the point of diminishing returns on the "the bigger the LLM, the smarter it will be" theme, we now move to the NoLLM epoch of the LLM Era of AI. LLMs are just one component in a broader system that also includes ghosts of the AI summers of the past: expert systems/rule engines (like Prolog), the Semantic Web & knowledge graphs (RDF/OWL), and good old-fashioned non-neural-network machine learning (decision trees, clusters, association, regressions).

The collection opens with a preface and introduction that set the stage for what I call the NOLLM epoch of the LLM era—where large language models are important but not the only story. Expert systems, the Semantic Web, and non-LLM machine learning all still play vital roles. To make the essays easy to navigate, there’s an index with short summaries so readers can jump into whichever part of the assemblage speaks to them.

As I'm still very much thinking about thinking :), this is a work in progress, so I'll be adding things that fit here over the coming months, years.
