# Understanding AI as Assemblage

*Published on January 14, 2025*

## Introduction

Rather than viewing artificial intelligence as isolated systems or monolithic technologies, assemblage theory offers a more nuanced understanding of AI as complex, heterogeneous networks of components that interact in dynamic and emergent ways.

## What is Assemblage Theory?

Assemblage theory, developed by philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, provides a framework for understanding complex systems not as unified wholes, but as compositions of diverse elements that maintain their distinctiveness while functioning together.

### Key Characteristics of Assemblages:

- **Heterogeneity**: Composed of diverse components (technical, social, material, symbolic)
- **Relationality**: Defined by relationships and interactions rather than essential properties
- **Emergent Properties**: Capabilities arise from interactions that exceed the sum of parts
- **Dynamic Boundaries**: Fluid borders that can expand, contract, or reconfigure

## AI as Assemblage

When we examine AI systems through this lens, we see they are not merely algorithms running on computers, but complex assemblages that include:

### Technical Components
- **Algorithms and Models**: The mathematical foundations and computational structures
- **Hardware Infrastructure**: GPUs, data centers, networking equipment
- **Software Frameworks**: Training platforms, deployment tools, monitoring systems

### Data Assemblages
- **Training Datasets**: Vast collections of human-generated content and behavior
- **Real-time Inputs**: Continuous streams of sensor data, user interactions, environmental signals
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for learning and adaptation

### Human Elements
- **Developers and Engineers**: Those who design, implement, and maintain systems
- **Data Laborers**: Human workers who clean, label, and curate training data
- **End Users**: Individuals whose interactions shape system behavior and capabilities

### Institutional Networks
- **Corporate Structures**: Companies that fund, develop, and deploy AI systems
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Government agencies and standards organizations
- **Academic Institutions**: Research centers and universities advancing AI knowledge

## Emergent Properties

The assemblage perspective reveals how AI capabilities emerge from interactions across these diverse components:

### Collective Intelligence
AI systems develop capabilities that exceed what any individual component could achieve. A language model's ability to generate coherent text emerges from the complex interactions between training data, neural network architectures, and computational resources.

### Adaptive Behavior
Through continuous interaction with users and environments, AI assemblages demonstrate adaptive behaviors that weren't explicitly programmed, arising from the dynamic relationships within the system.

### Social Learning
AI systems don't just process data—they participate in social learning processes, incorporating human values, biases, and cultural patterns through their training and deployment.

## Implications for AI Development

Understanding AI as assemblage has profound implications:

### Design Considerations
- Focus on relationships and interactions, not just individual components
- Consider the broader ecosystem in which AI systems operate
- Design for emergent properties and unintended consequences

### Ethical Frameworks
- Responsibility distributed across the assemblage, not localized to individual actors
- Need for systemic approaches to AI ethics and governance
- Recognition of how power relations shape AI development and deployment

### Innovation Strategies
- Innovation emerges from novel combinations and connections
- Value creation through orchestrating assemblages, not just building components
- Importance of platform ecosystems and network effects

## Conclusion

Viewing AI through the lens of assemblage theory reveals the rich complexity underlying what might appear as simple technological systems. This perspective helps us better understand how AI capabilities emerge, how they interact with human and social systems, and how we might more effectively govern and develop these technologies.

By recognizing AI as assemblage, we move beyond simplistic notions of technological determinism toward a more nuanced understanding of how artificial intelligence is deeply embedded in and co-constituted by the social, material, and institutional contexts in which it operates.
