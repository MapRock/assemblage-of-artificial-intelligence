chief_complaint,Initial report of the main problem that caused the customer to seek help and describes the visible symptom or failure from the customer perspective,Customer contacts the service provider and explains that the system is not behaving normally. The user describes the main symptom and explains that the normal task cannot be completed. The problem appears during normal use and the customer wants assistance understanding why it is happening. The report focuses on what the user experiences rather than the technical cause. The technician records the main issue that triggered the request for help so the investigation can begin with a clear statement of the problem,complaint|customer_report|problem|symptom|issue|failure|not_working|initial_problem|user_problem
background,Context and history explaining events or conditions leading up to the issue including recent changes prior incidents or unusual activity,Customer explains events that happened before the issue began. The description may include recent changes updates configuration adjustments or unusual activity. The technician gathers details about timing environment and earlier conditions to understand the context of the failure. This stage focuses on collecting history rather than solving the problem. The background helps the technician understand what may have influenced the system before the issue appeared and provides useful clues for the next investigative steps,history|context|recent_change|prior_event|conditions|before_issue|started_after|environment|customer_history
diagnosis,Expert statement of the likely cause of the issue based on the complaint and gathered background information,Technician reviews the reported symptoms together with the background information. Based on experience and technical understanding the technician proposes a likely explanation for the problem. The explanation describes what component process or condition may be responsible. At this stage the explanation is still a hypothesis that guides further testing. The purpose of the diagnosis is to translate the observed problem into a technical understanding of what may be happening within the system,diagnosis|cause|hypothesis|suspected_issue|root_cause|analysis|initial_assessment|technical_explanation
setup_sensors,Preparation of monitoring tools or diagnostic instruments that will gather information about the system behavior,Technician prepares equipment that will capture information about how the system behaves during testing. Monitoring tools diagnostic instruments or logging systems are enabled so measurements can be collected. The technician may connect gauges activate sensors or enable monitoring software. The purpose of this step is to ensure that meaningful information will be captured while the system operates. Proper preparation allows the next step of data collection to provide reliable observations about the system condition,setup_sensors|connect_tools|enable_monitoring|install_sensor|start_logging|prepare_diagnostics|setup_measurement
collect_data,Gathering raw measurements logs readings or observations from instruments sensors or monitoring systems,Technician runs the system while monitoring tools capture readings and observations. Measurements logs or system responses are recorded so that the behavior of the system can be observed. The technician may repeat tests or monitor different parts of the system while gathering information. The focus of this stage is collecting data rather than interpreting it. The recorded information becomes the evidence that will later be used to understand the source of the problem,collect_data|record_readings|capture_logs|measure_system|run_test|gather_observations|data_collection
analyze_data,Interpretation of the collected measurements or logs to determine patterns anomalies or likely causes of the issue,Technician studies the readings and logs that were gathered during testing. The technician compares results with expected system behavior and looks for patterns unusual values or inconsistencies. Through careful review the technician identifies clues that point toward the likely source of the problem. This stage transforms raw measurements into meaningful insight that helps confirm or refine the diagnosis of the issue,analyze_data|review_logs|evaluate_readings|find_pattern|identify_anomaly|data_analysis|investigate_results
treatment_plan,Proposed corrective action that describes the repair replacement adjustment or procedure intended to resolve the issue,Technician develops a plan to correct the issue based on the diagnosis and analysis results. The proposed solution may involve replacing a component adjusting a configuration repairing a connection or performing another corrective action. The plan explains how the issue will be resolved and what steps will be taken to restore normal operation. The purpose is to clearly describe the recommended fix before work begins,treatment_plan|proposed_solution|repair_plan|corrective_action|recommended_fix|service_plan
estimate_cost,Calculation or estimation of the cost time or resources required to perform the proposed treatment plan,Technician evaluates the work required to complete the repair and estimates the resources involved. This may include labor time replacement parts tools and other materials. The goal is to provide a realistic expectation of the effort required to carry out the treatment plan. The estimate helps the customer understand the likely cost and time associated with resolving the issue,estimate_cost|cost_estimate|labor_estimate|repair_cost|parts_cost|service_cost
present_treatment_cost,Communication of the proposed repair plan and cost estimate to the customer for approval before work begins,Technician explains the recommended repair and the expected cost to the customer. The explanation includes what work will be performed and why the proposed action should resolve the problem. This discussion allows the customer to review the repair plan and decide whether to authorize the work. The purpose of this stage is to ensure the customer understands both the solution and the cost before service begins,present_estimate|explain_cost|review_repair_plan|customer_review|repair_discussion
customer_rejects_treatment,Customer declines the proposed repair plan or refuses the estimated cost and chooses not to proceed,Customer reviews the proposed repair plan and decides not to proceed with the service at this time. The decision may be related to cost timing or preference. The technician records that the recommended treatment was declined. This step documents that the repair was offered but the customer chose not to authorize the work,reject_repair|decline_service|customer_refusal|no_authorization|cancel_repair
customer_accepts_treatment,Customer approves the treatment plan and authorizes the expert to proceed with the repair or corrective action,Customer reviews the explanation of the proposed repair and agrees that the service should proceed. Authorization is given for the technician to perform the corrective work described in the treatment plan. This approval allows the technician to begin implementing the repair steps required to resolve the issue,approve_repair|authorize_service|customer_agreement|proceed_with_repair
execute_treatment,Expert performs the repair replacement adjustment or corrective action described in the treatment plan,Technician performs the repair work described in the treatment plan. Components may be replaced adjustments may be made or configurations corrected. The technician follows the defined procedure to restore the system to proper operation. This stage represents the actual execution of the corrective work intended to resolve the problem,execute_repair|perform_service|replace_component|repair_action|apply_fix
test_treatment_application,Verification step where the expert tests the system after the repair to confirm that the issue has been resolved,Technician operates the system after completing the repair to confirm that the problem has been resolved. The system is observed under normal conditions to verify that the previous symptoms no longer appear. The goal is to ensure that the repair successfully restored proper operation,test_system|verify_fix|confirm_operation|check_results|validate_repair
prepare_report,Creation of documentation summarizing the issue investigation actions taken and final outcome of the incident,Technician prepares written documentation describing the incident. The report summarizes the problem investigation steps taken and the repair actions performed. The documentation records what was discovered during troubleshooting and how the issue was resolved so the service history is preserved,prepare_report|document_findings|write_report|service_notes|incident_record
present_report,Delivery or submission of the incident report or documentation to the customer or organization,Technician provides the completed report to the customer or records it within the service system.
