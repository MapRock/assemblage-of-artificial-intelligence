You are an expert in enterprise AI architectures, knowledge graphs, and vector databases in 2026. I just read Eugene's blog post "The Products of System 2 – Prolog in the LLM Era" (Feb 27, 2026). The key section is "The Enterprise Vector Memory".
I need a vector database (or hybrid graph+vector system) that serves as the semantic index / enterprise memory cache for the following exact use case:

It indexes and enables fast fuzzy rediscovery of many different artifact types via embeddings: states, plans, stories, Prolog rules/snippets, text documents, serialized Python/ML models (pickle/PMML), JSON, RDF/OWL knowledge graphs, IRIs, URLs to services/functions, etc.
For each artifact it stores:
The embedding vector itself
A short abstract/summary describing the artifact
Rich, arbitrary metadata/attributes (file type, last update time, confidence scores, provenance, IRI references, domain tags, etc.)
A pointer/reference to the full artifact (which lives in blob storage or another system)

Full text or document content should be stored alongside the embedding when useful (so I can retrieve the actual content without always hitting blob storage).
It must support fast similarity search (cosine or Euclidean) on the embeddings.
Because the overall framework heavily uses RDF IRIs, story graphs, conditional trade-off graphs, and Prolog snippets grounded via IRIs, strong preference for native graph capabilities (nodes/relationships with properties) so the vector index can sit directly on top of or inside a knowledge graph.
It needs to act as a cache for an "Explorer subgraph" that resolves and caches new IRIs and their summaries.
Enterprise-grade: scalable to millions/billions of vectors, good governance/provenance, querying that works well with LLMs, Prolog, RDF tools, and hybrid vector + graph traversal.

I personally love Neo4j because it is a mature graph database with excellent native vector indexes (including the new native VECTOR type, metadata filtering inside the vector index as of 2026.01, rich properties on nodes/relationships for text + attributes, and seamless Cypher integration). Please include Neo4j in your recommendations and compare everything else to it.
Task:
Give me your top 5 recommendations (ranked by best overall fit for the exact use case above). For each one:

Short description of why it fits (or doesn't perfectly fit)
How well it handles storing full text + embedding + rich arbitrary attributes/metadata
Graph capabilities (if any) and how well they integrate with vector search
Pros and cons specifically for this "Enterprise Vector Memory" pattern in a Prolog/RDF/LLM-heavy architecture
Deployment model (fully managed, self-hosted OSS, hybrid) and rough pricing note for 2026
Any standout integrations (LangChain/LlamaIndex, RDF export, Prolog, etc.)

End with a concise comparison table and a one-sentence recommendation of the single best choice if I want maximum graph power + vector performance with minimal operational pain.
Be honest about trade-offs. Base your answer on real 2026 capabilities (Neo4j vector improvements, Weaviate hybrid search, ArangoDB multi-model, Qdrant filtering, Pinecone, Milvus/Zilliz, pgvector, etc.). Focus on fit for the described architecture, not generic RAG.
