# Plumber’s Field Notebook — Residential Service Call

Received a call this morning from the homeowner about the upstairs shower. They said the hot water has been coming out only lukewarm for the past few days, and the pressure seems weaker than usual. According to them the problem seemed to start sometime after they had several guests staying over the weekend and everyone was using the bathrooms more than normal. The customer sounded concerned that the water heater might be failing or that something was wrong with the shower valve. Scheduled a visit for tomorrow afternoon to take a closer look.

Arrived at the residence and spoke again with the homeowner in person. They repeated that the shower water never really gets hot anymore and the stream coming from the shower head seems noticeably weaker. They mentioned that the kitchen sink and bathroom sink still get hot water eventually, but the shower takes longer and never reaches the same temperature. I told them my first thought is that it could be a partially clogged shower cartridge, mineral buildup in the head, or possibly an issue with the mixing valve restricting the hot side. Let them know I would start by measuring water temperature and pressure at several fixtures to narrow it down.

Set up a few basic checks before taking anything apart. Connected a small pressure gauge to the shower arm and used a thermometer to see what temperature the hot line was actually reaching. Ran the shower for several minutes while watching the gauge and checking the temperature of the hot supply line coming from the heater. Took notes on the pressure readings and also checked the kitchen faucet to compare the hot water temperature there.

Collected the readings from the tests. The pressure at the shower is noticeably lower than at the nearby sink, which suggests something is restricting flow specifically in the shower assembly. The water heater itself appears to be delivering hotter water than what is reaching the shower. After looking at the numbers and feeling the supply pipes, it seems likely the mixing cartridge in the shower valve is partially clogged with mineral deposits, which would both reduce pressure and limit how much hot water can pass through.

Explained my findings to the homeowner. Told them the most probable fix would be removing the shower handle and replacing or cleaning the mixing cartridge, and while I’m there I’d also inspect the shower head for buildup. Mentioned that if the cartridge is heavily scaled it’s usually better to replace it entirely rather than clean it. Provided an estimate for the parts and labor to replace the cartridge and reassemble the valve.

Customer reviewed the estimate and asked a few questions about whether the water heater itself might still be involved. After explaining that the heater is producing adequate temperature and that the restriction appears localized to the shower valve, they agreed to proceed with replacing the cartridge.

Shut off the water supply and removed the shower handle and trim plate. Pulled out the existing cartridge and found significant mineral buildup around the internal ports, which would definitely restrict flow. Installed a new cartridge, flushed the lines briefly to clear debris, and reassembled the valve and handle.

Turned the water back on and ran the shower again. Pressure at the head is now noticeably stronger, and the temperature rises properly within about a minute. Let the shower run for a few cycles of hot and cold to make sure the mixing valve is operating correctly and that there are no leaks behind the trim.

Checked back with the homeowner after they used the shower this morning. They confirmed the water is now getting hot again and the pressure feels normal. Prepared a brief report summarizing the issue, the diagnostic steps taken, and the replacement of the clogged mixing cartridge. Submitted the invoice for the service call and replacement part.

Payment received from the homeowner for the completed repair. Issue appears fully resolved with no additional complaints reported since the work was completed.
