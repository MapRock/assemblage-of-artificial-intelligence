# Event Set Abstracts

## Event Set: Troubleshooting Service Event Set
**Purpose**: Reactive, incident-based troubleshooting and repair services performed by skilled experts to diagnose and resolve unexpected problems  
**(e.g.** doctor treating acute illness, plumber fixing a leak, IT repairing a system crash**)**

**Description**:  
Captures a typical diagnostic-repair workflow in average ordinal sequence (events can vary, loop, or iterate). The process begins with the customer stating the issue, progresses through hypothesis formation, data collection and analysis, solution proposal and customer approval, execution and testing of the fix, outcome verification, and concludes with reporting and billing.  

**Key characteristics**:
- Emphasizes iterative diagnosis
- Requires customer consent at critical decision points
- Includes explicit verification that the problem is resolved
- Handles rejection scenarios (treatment or outcome)

## Event Set: Routine Service Event Set
**Purpose**: Proactive, recurring, or scheduled routine service delivery by trained providers for expected, non-emergency tasks  
**(e.g.** restaurant dining service, regular lawn mowing, annual medical checkup, house cleaning**)**

**Description**:  
Outlines a standard procedural flow in average ordinal order (flexible, with possible loops). The sequence starts with welcoming the customer and assessing current needs, includes preparation, execution of the core service, in-progress feedback checks, final verification of completion, wrap-up summary, payment handling, friendly farewell, and internal record-keeping.

**Key characteristics**:
- Focuses on smooth, positive customer experience
- Prioritizes value-added support and small enhancements
- Emphasizes clean, courteous closure
- No deep problem diagnosis — assumes the service is routine/preventive/performative
