I bought a kahili ginger root (one of those few inch souvenirs) at Hilo Hattie on my way home from visiting my mom on Oʻahu in 2003. For twenty-two years it never bloomed, although it would grow very nicely and looked very healthy.

Where we lived, Boise, I knew the dry, hot summers and very cold winters would be rough on a tropical plant. From mid-May to early October I kept it outside under a tree with my ti plants—partial sun, hit by the sprinklers most days. The rest of the year it lived in the garage with other plants. Because it had to move so much, it stayed in a pot that I repotted several times as it outgrew each one. I brought it into the house a few times, but it was too dry and it took up too much room. Still no blooms.

Three years ago, around September (a month before I needed to bring it in) we finally saw a bud, but it didn’t have time to open before it dried up—that was one of the years I had moved it indoors, so that didn't help.

This year I did something different. The plant had grown too big to sit under the tree along with the ti plants without blocking the sprinklers, so I put it in the only space we had where it would get a few hours of direct sun. I was ready to give up anyway. To offset the heat, I misted and watered the leaves during those sunny hours to cool it, and I fed it with an organic fertilizer from our local Zamzows.

A few weeks ago (in late july) a bud appeared—earlier than the other two years. We still figured it would dry up. It began to open with no flowers showing, and then one day a green bract pushed out a flower, then another, climbing upward until we had a full spike.

I can’t say for sure why it finally bloomed, but my best guess is that I’d been protecting it from the very thing it needed: more sun. I assumed Boise’s desert light would be too harsh for something that evolved in humid, tropical weather. Most of the winning changes happened after I’d essentially given up—forced to try a new spot, then compensating for the risk with leaf-cooling and fertilizer.
