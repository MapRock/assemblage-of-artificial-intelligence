# Reptile Intelligence: An AI Summer for CEP

This repository contains examples, diagrams, and code fragments related to the blog post  
[**Reptile Intelligence: An AI Summer for CEP**](https://eugeneasahara.com/2025/09/25/reptile-intelligence-an-ai-summer-for-cep/).

The blog explores Complex Event Processing (CEP) as a foundational component of intelligence, comparing:
- **Worm intelligence** (reflexive, limited CEP as seen in Azure Stream Analytics).
- **Reptile intelligence** (massive rule integration, richer pattern recognition, scalable CEP with Flink).
- How CEP complements other components in the **Assemblage of AI** alongside knowledge graphs, Prolog, machine learning, and LLMs.

## Contents
- **Diagrams** — Petri nets, NFAs, and architectural sketches illustrating CEP at different levels of intelligence.
- **Code Examples** — Flink SQL and PyFlink CEP patterns (e.g., sleep stage NFA).
- **Notes** — Comparisons of CEP platforms (Stream Insight, ASA, Flink), reflections on scaling rules, and ties to Time Molecules.

## Purpose
This repo is not production software but a companion to the blog. It provides conceptual and runnable snippets that illustrate how CEP fits into a larger AI architecture.
